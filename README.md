# DOS ASSEMBLY SIMPLE MULTICHOICE QUIZ
A multichoice quiz made in assembly for DOS operating systems. 
# Why mention DOS specifically? 
The first reason is because it uses DOS interrupts. But if you have the knowledge, you can modify the source code to change these
with system calls that are compatible with your target operating system. 
Obviously, as a result, this is also made for the x86 CPU architecture. Which means that I don't guarantee it's going to work on other CPU architectures
without modifications to the instructions used.
And the second reason? Because it's cool.
# The program's structure
The program is structured quite well (it's my program, of course I'm not going to criticize myself). The code is organized and documented
in such a way that it should be easy to add more questions, or edit the current ones, even if you have almost no assembly knowledge!
# Why this name?
I don't have a better name for it. What you see is what you get, after all. I guess you could use an acronym to refer to it though, such as DASMQ. I dunno...
